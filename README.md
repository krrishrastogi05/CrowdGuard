### Panoptic Surveillance & Intelligent Crisis Response System

> **"Turning Chaos into Order."** > An AI-powered command center that synthesizes unstructured real-time data (Social Media, Voice Calls) into actionable intelligence for emergency response.

## 🚀 The Problem
In the critical moments following a disaster (fire, riot, flood), control rooms are overwhelmed with noise. 
* **Information Overload:** Thousands of social media posts and panic calls.
* **Unstructured Data:** Images, voice recordings, and text are hard to map.
* **Slow Response:** Manual verification takes too long.

## 💡 The Solution
**ARGUS.AI** acts as the central nervous system for city safety. It uses **Google Gemini Multimodal AI** to instantly analyze incoming media, extract geolocation and severity, and visualize it on a real-time map for immediate dispatch.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🗺️ Live Command Dashboard
* **Real-time Visualization:** Incidents appear instantly on a Leaflet map via WebSockets.
* **Asset Tracking:** Live tracking of Police, Fire, and Medical units.
* **Smart Dispatch:** "Deploy" button calculates distances and assigns the nearest available unit visually.

### 2. 🤖 Multimodal AI Analysis (Powered by Gemini)
* **Forensic Breakdown:** AI analyzes images and text to identify evidence (e.g., "Visual match: Smoke plume", "Acoustics: Screams").
* **Auto-Geolocation:** Extracts address and coordinates from vague user descriptions.
* **Severity Scoring:** Automatically rates incidents from 1-10 to prioritize response.

### 3. 📱 Crowd-Sourced Intelligence Simulators
* **Social Feed Simulator:** A "Twitter-like" interface to inject mock citizen reports (Text + Images) into the system.
* **Emergency Helpline Simulator:** Uses the **Web Speech API** to record voice distress calls, transcribing and analyzing them in real-time.

### 4. 📢 Public Advisory System
* **AI-Drafted Alerts:** The dashboard operator can generate authoritative, context-aware public warnings for specific incidents with one click.
* **Instant Broadcast:** Advisories are immediately pushed to the public social feed.

### 5. 🔒 Secure Architecture
* **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF):** AI keys are secured on the server. Client-side media processing ensures speed without compromising security.
